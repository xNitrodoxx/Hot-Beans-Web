I started in 2021, after the COVID pandemic had died down. During the pandemic, I had been busy learning the basics of Administration, and through social media like Twitter and Instagram, I had made valuable connections, one of those being to Hot Beans Web. It's fun and challenging, and I love this line of work!</p>
