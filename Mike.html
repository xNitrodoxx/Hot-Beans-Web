In school, I never really knew how to work with Databases, and I often struggled in class. However, my teacher recommended I go to Hot Beans Web and ask them for more help, since he had connections to them. And ever since, I have been under their wing, learning from my colleagues within the company, and eventually, I became a Database Administrator!<br>
<p style="float: right; width: 67vw; background-color: #696969; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 30px"> Skills needed to become a Database Administrator:<br>
