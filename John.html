When I first came to Hot Beans Web, it was to ask about if they had any vacancies, and they did, but it was for a Supervisor role. I wasn't comfortable with it at first, but after talking with the others in the company, I got used to it. I learned about HTML and CSS from my team members, and I can say confidently, that if I was asked to create my own website, I would be able to!<p>
<p style="float: right; width: 67vw; background-color: #696969; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 30px"> Skills needed to become a Supervisor:<br>
Good communication skills.<br>
Able to work well with a team and give instructions.<br>
